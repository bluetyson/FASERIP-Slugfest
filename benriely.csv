Voluntary or involuntary deprivation of blood resulted in weakness (-1cs on all stats for every 2 days without blood) and an overwhelming desire for blood. A Psyche FEAT put off that desire for one day, but the need remained. ', '-Soil Dependency: Vampires could not go 100 miles beyond their places of human birth without taking a pound of soil with them. This soil, usually used to line a coffin, offset the negative effects of the sun. ', ""-Direct Sunlight: The rays of the suncaused Am damage per round to vampires. If reduced to zero Health points, a vampire dehydrated and turned to powder. Sunlight also caused vampires not under its effects to become comatose unless in contact with native soil. Energy attacks which duplicated solar radiation (such as the new Captain Marvel’s powers or Superman's Heat Vision) could affect vampires. "", '-Garlic Plants: A vampire could not directly attack a victim wearing a clove of garlic (the vampire could push a wall over on the garlic-wearer, though, or perform similar actions). Further, a vampire’s transformation abilities could not function within 1 area of garlic. ', '-Religious Objects: Vampires had an allergy of sorts to objects of religious faith, such that any religious symbol (such as the cross or the Star of David) held by someone who had great faith in that symbol would keep a vampire at bay. Such a symbol inflicted normal damage (as a club, sword, or shuriken) to the vampire. ', '-Mirrors: Vampires did not reflect an image in mirrors, nor show up on photographic plates or similar mediums. ', '-Houses: Most vampires were bound by a code that prevented them from entering a dwelling unless freely invited. Dracula could counter that by making a Psyche FEAT roll. ', '-Silver: Silver weaponry could inflict normal damage on and could even kill vampire. ', '-Wood: A wooden stake through the heart produced an automatic ""kill"" result against a vampire. Of course, this meant holding the vampire down and getting a ""Red"" result with the attack. A wood stake or silver blade through the heart caused a vampire to decay into dust, but the dust reassembled and the vampire started to heal as soon as the stake or blade was removed. ', '-Permanent Destruction: All vampires had a tendency to regenerate lost damage over time, even if chopped into tiny pieces.

Voluntary or involuntary deprivation of blood resulted in weakness (-1cs on all stats for every 2 days without blood) and an overwhelming desire for blood. A Psyche FEAT put off that desire for one day, but the need remained. ', '-Soil Dependency: Vampires could not go 100 miles beyond their places of human birth without taking a pound of soil with them. This soil, usually used to line a coffin, offset the negative effects of the sun. ', ""-Direct Sunlight: The rays of the sun caused Am damage per round to vampires. If reduced to zero Health points, a vampire dehydrated and turned to powder. Sunlight also caused vampires not under its effects to become comatose unless in contact with native soil. Energy attacks which duplicated solar radiation (such as the new Captain Marvel’s powers or Superman's Heat Vision) could affect vampires. "", '-Garlic Plants: A vampire could not directly attack a victim wearing a clove of garlic (the vampire could push a wall over on the garlic-wearer, though, or perform similar actions). Further, a vampire’s transformation abilities could not function within 1 area of garlic. ', '-Religious Objects: Vampires had an allergy of sorts to objects of religious faith, such that any religious symbol (such as the cross or the Star of David) held by someone who had great faith in that symbol would keep a vampire at bay. Such a symbol inflicted normal damage (as a club, sword, or shuriken) to the vampire. ', '-Mirrors: Vampires did not reflect an image in mirrors, nor show up on photographic plates or similar mediums. ', '-Houses: Most vampires were bound by a code that prevented them from entering a dwelling unless freely invited. Dracula could counter that by making a Psyche FEAT roll. ', '-Silver: Silver weaponry could inflict normal damage on and could even kill vampire. ', '-Wood: A wooden stake through the heart produced an automatic ""kill"" result against a vampire. Of course, this meant holding the vampire down and getting a ""Red"" result with the attack. A wood stake or silver blade through the heart caused a vampire to decay into dust, but the dust reassembled and the vampire started to heal as soon as the stake or blade was removed.
