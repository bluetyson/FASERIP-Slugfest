class Encounter(EncounterAction):
    """
    The encounter class is the arena for the battle
    In a dimentionless model, move action and the main actions dash, disengage, hide, shove back/aside, tumble and overrun are meaningless.
    weapon attack —default
    two-weapon attack —
        Good when the opponent has low AC (<12) if 2nd attack is without proficiency.
        Stacks with bonuses such as sneak attack or poisoned weapons —neither are in the model.
        Due to the 1 action for donning/doffing a shield, switch to two handed is valid for unshielded folk only.
        Best keep two weapon fighting as a prebuild not a combat switch.
    AoE spell attack — Layout…
    targetted spell attack —produce flame is a cantrip so could be written up as a weapon. The bigger ones. Spell slots need to be re-written.
    spell buff —Barkskin is a druidic imperative. Haste? Too much complication.
    spell debuff —Bane…
    dodge —targetted and turn economy
    help —high AC target (>18), turn economy, beefcake ally
    ready —teamwork preplanning. No way.
    grapple/climb —very situational. grapple/shove combo or barring somatic.
    disarm —disarm… grey rules about whether picking it up or kicking it away is an interact/move/bonus/main action.
        netting is a better option albeit a build.
    called shot —not an official rule. Turn economy.
