# Character Generator
Work in progress on an Ultimate Powers Book version - 
- Notebook here that can do a loop of characters, output to json and make a dataframe and csv that will eventually be customised to bestiaryFASERIP.csv type format for FASERIP-Slugfests.
- There are two types - Composite and Compound Form - which basically involve making up multiple character forms - possibly implemented later, for now I will replace them with Mutants [because X-Men].  For the purposes of tying into a simulation that would be difficult - in programming terms, sub-Creature character objects switching out stats.  Even just for a character generator.
- Metamorphic robots can also generate an extra form, this is not done currently either.
- Some types like animal, vegetable, mineral of course would pick something - another could make a customised list for each, same with Extra Parts, others like that.
